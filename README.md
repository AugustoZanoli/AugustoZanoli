## ðŸ’» About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Augusto de Camargos Zanoli, a Computer Information Systems student at UNIFEI (Brazil) passionate about software development and technology that connects people.

I currently serve as Vice President of the Computer Science Student Directory and have experience working in a Junior Enterprise (JE), which gave me practical exposure to real-world projects and teamwork.

I work mainly with Java (Spring Boot) and Angular, building full-stack applications focused on clean architecture and real impact.
Iâ€™ve also earned medals in OBI and OBR, reflecting my strong background in logic and problem-solving.

Iâ€™m currently improving my English and exploring international opportunities such as MEXT and AIESEC programs in Japan â€” combining cultural exchange with professional growth.

Always learning, building, and aiming to write code that makes sense â€” not just that works. ðŸš€
